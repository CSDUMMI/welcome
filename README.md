> The main repository for discussing orbit

[`orbit-db`](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. `orbit-db` uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as its data storage and [IPFS Pubsub](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/core/commands/pubsub.go#L23) to automatically sync databases with peers. It's an eventually consistent database that uses [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) for conflict-free database merges making `orbit-db` an excellent choice for offline-first applications.

This organization is a place to bring together all fo the Orbit repositories, and to work together on making orbit better. This repo is the center of that organization.

## Project Directory

Below, a list of all of the projects in the orbit-db organization is listed.

**Captains** are the active leads for each project. Their responsibilities are to make sure that issues and pull requests are attended to in a timely manner, and general upkeep. If you have questions about a repository, or need feedback, please contact them as appropriate.

TODO: Add projects here. See #1.

### Naming

Why `orbitdb`? Because it was available on GitHub, and it matches [`orbitdb`](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db). Why `Orbit`? Because that is the name of [the chat app built on top of orbit-db](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit). Why was that called `Orbit`? You'll have to ask [@haadcode](https://github.com/haadcode), but it's probably something to do with the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs).
