## Notes

* Zoom calendaring issues fixed! We shouldn't be experiencing any timing problems anymore
* "When the database is ready"
    * to recap: not an easy way to know when a database has "finished syncing"
    * Tyler made a pull request and is in discussion https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/pull/514
    * Use case: knowing when one is "caught up" with a certain peer
    * Reality: we cannot ever **for sure** know if the database is up to date and, however there are certain guarantees we can make
        * In particular, on initial load
        * When a node is stopped, it's easy to know since no new patterns would be written
    * Tyler's solution is based on exchange of heads and emptying the queue
* Access Control
    * What remains: Identity Provider - linking external IDS to OrbitDB
        * Very close - this week, perhaps?
        * Need to decouple Access and Identity in certain places in the code
        * Some duplicate verification happening - consider allowing identities with no signatures
            * Central point: IPFS would be treated as an "external identity" provider
* Values as Traversal
    * In progress, dealing with the sorting of heads in the
* Please lint using https://standardjs.com!
* Encryption in `ipfs-log`
    * Tyler created an issue
    * Haad and Shams provided concerns
        * Complex, hard to get right from security primitives
        * IPFS does not provide encryption primitives
        * What happens when keys are revoked? Re-encrypt
* Large Scale database https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-docstore/issues/11
    * Very complex issue but team is available on Gitter for detailed discussion
* Breakout session back to Values as Traversal
    * DanielVF brought up some other use cases - wanting to stay in the same "dag chain" - think of like a git branch
