## Agenda
- No agenda items, let's go through what's been happening
- Dynamic access control work continues
    - PR at https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/pull/495
    - access controllers now in their own repo
        - https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-access-controllers
    - IPFS based ac (immutable)
    - OrbitDB-based ac (mutable, eventually consistent)
        - revocation still work in progress
    - smart contract based ac (mutable, smart contract / external system decides consistency properties)
    - Q: does smart acess controller support revocation?
        - not completely yet, some work required to have full support
- Got a logo! \o/
    - final assets coming, working them out
    - different color variations
    - we'll get stickers (@richardlitt)
        - open an issue on GH to coordinate logistics
- FAQ process:
    - list possible questions? @richardlitt will add PR asap

- General updates:
    - Biggest priority: finish AC, merge into master and release modules
    - Get smart-contract stuff working. Not missing many items
    - Will publish modules to npm

- @oed: function to generate odb address w/o opening store, PR coming soon hopefully
- Nodejs browser talking to nodejs having problems....@oed: we are doing this, caveat is must connect directly with swarm.connect and secure websockets.
    - @haad: anything special in browser node config for bootstrapping or anything? @oed: no
    - could be pubsub issue, will look into it
- Another pubsub issue: when peer subscribebs to room, takes long time for peer to enter
    - pubsub should be fast, if taking long time there could be an issue, if peers are not already connected, it may be the reason it takes a while. (could be related to Pubsub issue mentioned above)
