- **Moderator:** @vvp
- **Notetaker:** @RichardLitt
- **Attendees:**
- @haadcode
- @RichardLitt
- @vongohren
- @vvp

## Agenda
- Suggested Code of Conduct: [welcome#10](https://github.com/orbitdb/welcome/issues/10) (@RichardLitt, 5 minutes)
- @haadcode: Snorre, Regarding PubSub, there's no plans to change it. It's one of the key components regarding how data gets replicated. There's no plans to sync it over anything else. It could be replaced with another pubsub primitive, like a centralized one, but we don't plan to do that.
- @haadcode: Someone is now working on OrbitChat! There's already a PR, as of two hours ago. https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-web/pull/21

## Q&A, Help Wanted
- @vvp: There was something on Gitter about Infura.
    - @vongohren: That was mostly me and Kevin. @oed was trying to help. Nothing to worry about. 
    - @haadcode: Infura: An Ethereum-run IPFS node service. There's a lot of experimental stuff in IPFS that Infura doesn't support, and this is kind of a shame because it removes the point of IPFS. 
- @vongohren: Any good docs for good practice for running IPFS nodes?
    - @haadcode: ask on #ipfs on IRC? 
    - @vvp: You could also use Docker, maybe. There's a Docker image for IPFS.
