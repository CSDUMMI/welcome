## Agenda
- [ ] 0.21.0 release (shamb0t)
    - Only change there is the default AC checks against identity.id vs identity.publicKey
    - external identity stored id field (i.e. 3box keys, ethereum account id, etc)
    - same manifest, same orbitdb address. only change is checking against the identity.id
- [ ] HTTP API (Hayden)
    - Working with phillmac to expose HTTP2 stuff
    - Opens up possibilities for golang CLI
        - ready state / close / replicate
    - @aphelionz thinking of an activitypub proof of concept
        - https://activitypub.rocks
- [ ] Storage Adapter (Mark)
    - Lifted the cache one level up in keystore and orbit-db-cache, some performance improvements and the adapter now supports any abstract-level-down
- [ ] `ipfs-log` append performance
    - for better or worse, encryption/decryption is largest bottleneck
