## Agenda
- @shamb0t: We submitted a patch to issues with data loss when multiple tabs are open. 
- https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/pull/651/files
- @aphelionz: persistent-store PR should improve performance, keystore + identityprovider automated tests + a few other repos, next steps to have all tests pass and publish `next`
- CircleCI test chain for when one repo is changed to make sure dependees pass
- Roadmap review: https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/issues/585
- Future focused on supporting the existing features as opposed to introducing new features but feature requests tken from issues
- key-revocation: not supported, solution not trivial further discussion needed
