## Agenda
- Update: The rc is out. Take a look at it.
    - One issue with verifying entires, due to JavaScript object order. When you throw in an object for the entry in the payload, when you sing it, we stringify it, but it's not deterministic... so, we're working on workarounds to enable backwards compatibility.
    - @oed: The verifiable credentials group is making a spec for deterministically aggregating data. They have a standard for doing that. I don't know how far along they are.
        - It's kind of difficult to find. I'll see if I can send you the link.
        - Docs are a bit dense.
