## Moderator checklist

- [ ] Ensure that the moderator last week is the notetaker, or that someone else has volunteered
- [ ] Call for additional agenda items

## Agenda
- [ ] Performance work update (Mark)
    - Two main bottlenecks in OrbitDB: append and load
        - most were from opening/closing key transactions
        - lifted storage in keystore one level of abstraction up
            - 5-6x performance improvement in append
    - This scope of work should culminate in about a 6-10x performance increase on append
    - [ ] [referenceCount from 64 to 32](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-store/pull/55)
    - [ ] [persistent leveldb store in keystore](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-keystore/pull/30)
    - [ ] [Identity Provider Updates](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db-identity-provider/pull/29)
    - [ ] [Final PR](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/pull/623) Status: fixing tests
    - OrbitDB Cache idea (mostly for browsers benefit) - can perform similar optimization by not storing each orbitdb address in its own IndexeDB
- [ ] Pull Requests update (Shams)
    - [ ] Adding a LegacyIPFSAccessController makes sense for backwards-compatibility and a new IPFSAccessController which checks againts `identiy.id` by default so that new orbit-db keys can be created ephemerally and verified in the access-controller
- Circle back with 3box folks re: did / 3id in 2 weeks or so
