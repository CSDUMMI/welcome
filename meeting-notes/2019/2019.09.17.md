        - @oed: some background; when we open node locally, data doesn't sync, tries to sync before store has been loaded, PR syncs after store is loaded

        - @aphelionz: I've seen this in the wild, pubsub issues syncing, I believe its related
    - Pinning node (one address/odb instance) - cant handle loads of users
        - We would like to try a "load-balancer" ie many nodes pretending to be one
        - expect PR for a message broker in all places
        - Custom message broker
- Updates to IdentityProvider
    - Working on rolling up identity provider into a single OrbitDB provider
    - Preventing every identity from carrying its entire own provider
