## Agenda
_General discussions, decisions, etc._
- remove`cid`property from entries
    - there are currently 2 properties with the same hash in entries, some special cases in code to deal with old entries, not much gain in adding `cid` and hiding `hash`
- append function takes up bulk of time
    - each entry signed + written to ipfs
    - proposal: can batch write entries kept in-memory to ipfs periodically
