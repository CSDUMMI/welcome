- Update on Orbit Chat (@JaniAnttonen)
    - @latenssi has been working ipfs-log (remove in-memory caching) 
    - Working to make loading of old messages work better
    - 3 PRs open
    - tried out with orbit-db RC1, working to fix it (doesn't work yet, some error with the identity-provider)
- @phillmac and @hayden have been diligently working on a orbit-db REST API
    - should we test with the RC or wait for the official release?
        - should test it, the orbit-db API has changed (how to create an instance) so hopefully that works
    - almost there, awesome to see it happen
- Stickers! They're here!
    - Send richardlitt@orbitdb.org your address and how many you want, and he'll send them to you. 
- @oed on the approach to test the new release:
    - can I migrate a database without migrating the data of the database
        - yes, but you need to create a new key from the old keys (see identity-provider docs)
        - old identities can't append anymore (?), but the data will be there
