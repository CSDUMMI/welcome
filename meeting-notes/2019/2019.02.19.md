    - ETA this week, we hope
    - Big release, new access controller, identity system, improved log etc.
- @Schwartz10
    - evaluating OrbitDB, wanted to get an idea what to expect in terms of "production readiness"
    - generally production ready, but alpha-level software so APIs may break in the future, hasn't been security audited so heads-up
- @Abhi
    - Working on SmartX, using OrbitDB, really easy to get an app started and built with it
    - many questions, will follow up on Gitter
