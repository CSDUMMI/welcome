        - replicate-automatically.test.js failing consistently
    - Could be a config issue?
    - Next: Update changelog and docs, rebase/merge PR from last week to expose `pin` option in orbit-db
    - Bug in replication which slowed down performance fixed today 
- Philmac has issues sharing data, although he can share heads? Any ideas? (See Gitter)
    - Would be good to open an issue (could be replication issue mentioned above if using ipfs@0.40.x)
- @oed: In the process of updating to 0.22, looking good.
