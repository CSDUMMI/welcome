    - @RichardLitt's job!
    - OrbitDB is very important to us and we want to make sure people are informed and engaged
    - Keep an eye out!
- FAQ (@RichardLitt)
    - Updating in real time, and expressed as PRs
    - PRs do not affect code
    - thus, 1 approval is fine
- http://replicated.cc/swarm/ (@gritzko)
    - Embedded database, using [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org)
    - Goal: Small useful tool for developers.
    - "At this point in history, I put my hopes into Webassembly"
    - Hide all metadata inside the datastore, but expose plain text via the main API
    - Syncable storage engine, like `git` for your data
    - Asked about OrbitDB
        - History: OrbitDB started as a database on IPFS and still is
        - OrbitDB shares similarities with SwarmDB
        - OrbitDB uses CRDTs which have benefits and also trade-offs
        - "Merkle-CRDTs" paper coming out soon, which details this w/r/t IPFS and OrbitDB
    - Will ask more questions offline or on gitter
