### How is a node address sufficient for communicating with a remote database?

It depends on your IPFS setup â€” The IPFS network is used to store the data and thus content-routing and communication relies on how you setup and use IPFS. For instance, DHT content-routing, a big part of connectivity magic, is not fully operational in the JS implementation but working in the Go implementation. Thus, in the JS implementation its helpful to [configure a shared signalling server](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY2LufsW3v6AfxTTkp6SGqDGa5AeJhSZXH8RSsdiao4Ds/) so that your nodes can find each other.

**Brief overview of OrbitDBAddress as it relates to IPFS:**
The *magic* and crux of an OrbitDBAddress is the hash part, which is an IPFS [Multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash). The hash is used to retrieve a [database manifest](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/GUIDE.md#manifest), and subsequently an access controller. Both of which are objects stored on IPFS which is a content-addressable storage system. The hash in the OrbitDBAddress points to the database manifest and inside the database manifest is another hash that points to the Access Controller.

To replicate the entries in the database, the OrbitDBAddress is used as a topic on IPFS PubSub to exchange [heads](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log/blob/master/API.md#heads) which can be used to retrieve the rest of the entries as each entry links to the previous one, see [IPFS-Log](https://github.com/orbitdb/ipfs-log). 

Hope I understood your question correctly and provided a helpful answer ðŸ¥‚
